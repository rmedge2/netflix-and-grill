# Netflix & Grill

Netflix & Grill is a date night idea. The premis of the date includes a couple that decides to cook a meal together, and then watch a movie.

This application allows you to select a type of cuisine, and then select a genre for movies. The app will then generate 3 recipe options (with links to the recipes) alongside 3 movie options (with links to the movie previews). If you want to select new options, just press reset, and you can start again.
